I'm a graduate student in computer science at [UC Berkeley], advised by [Prof. Ras Bodik][bodik] and [Prof. Nir Yosef][yosef]. I'm currently living in Seattle, visiting the [PLSE lab][plse] at the [University of Washington][uw]. I'm interested in programming languages, program synthesis, compilers, machine learning, and software engineering. For my dissertation work, I'm developing program synthesis methods and tools as applied to the systems biology domain.

I have completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees at [EPFL], where my advisor was [Prof. Viktor Kuncak][kuncak]. For my M.Sc. thesis, I developed [Kaplan], an extension of Scala that supports constraint programming.

In Summer 2016, I was an intern at [Sift Science], and I worked on improving and accurately evaluating machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, as well as developing tools for efficiently summarizing customer data. In Summer 2013, I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research, Cambridge][msr cambridge], and I worked on developing algorithms for signaling pathway discovery from high-throughput data.

My résumé can be found [here][resume].
